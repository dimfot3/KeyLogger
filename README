This is a Key Logger written in c++.
Key Logger is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard.

In order to run the script:
 1. in line 8 put the the full path of the text file you want to save the key strokes (the text file doesnot have to exist)
 i.e "C:\\Users\\Yourname\\Desktop\\user\\log.txt" (the double "\\" is necessary for compiler to find the path)
 
 2. compile the program creating a executable file (to hide the executable file you should name it like a system file)
 
 3. run the executable file
 

The result whould be all the key strokes from your keyboard to be saved in the txt file you chosed.

In order to stop Keylogger you should go to task manger and stop your executable file.

Extra-tip: you could also run it with the cmd open if you delete line 90.

Use it wisely...
